This Python script connects to Amazon Athena, executes several SQL queries to fetch data related to COVID-19 from different tables, and transforms the results into Pandas DataFrames. It then merges these DataFrames to create fact and dimension tables. The script uploads these tables as CSV files to an S3 bucket and defines the schema for each table. Finally, it connects to Amazon Redshift and creates corresponding tables, copying the data from S3 to Redshift using the Redshift COPY command.

Here's a summary of the main steps:

1. **Connect to Athena:**
   - Sets up AWS credentials and connects to Amazon Athena using the `boto3` library.

2. **Query and Download Data:**
   - Executes multiple SQL queries on different Athena tables related to COVID-19 data.
   - Downloads the query results from S3 to Pandas DataFrames.

3. **Merge DataFrames:**
   - Merges the downloaded DataFrames to create fact and dimension tables.

4. **Upload to S3:**
   - Converts Pandas DataFrames to CSV format and uploads them to an S3 bucket.

5. **Define Schema:**
   - Extracts and prints the SQL schema for each table using Pandas functions.

6. **Connect to Redshift:**
   - Connects to Amazon Redshift using the `redshift_connector` library.

7. **Create Redshift Tables:**
   - Executes SQL commands to create tables in Redshift for each data set.

8. **Copy Data to Redshift:**
   - Uses the Redshift COPY command to load data from S3 into the corresponding Redshift tables.

Note: Certain parts of the code, such as AWS credentials, S3 bucket details, Redshift connection parameters, and other sensitive information, are either incomplete or missing. Ensure that you replace these placeholders with your actual credentials and configurations.
